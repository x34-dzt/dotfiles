New rice will have, Change wallpaper easily, themes, one waybar but with 3 types of styles, better rofi, and much more... I don't wanna spoil everything xD

I am still learning ricing and nixos,
NixOs was my first ever linux distro, I've been using from like a month now, I love it so much
so yeah, I am still a newbie here hehe :3

This readme is generated by ai, as I am lazy to write readme.

# 🧪 My NixOS Dotfiles

Hey there! This is my **NixOS** setup—crafted with care for devs like me who like things clean, reproducible, and kinda nerdy. It’s got what I need: system configs, Home Manager, and yeah, Neovim (because I use nvim btw).

---

## 🔸 What's Inside?

```
.
├── nixos             # System config (goes in /etc/nixos)
├── home-manager      # User-level config with standalone Home Manager (in ~/.config/home-manager)
├── nvim              # My Neovim setup (lives in ~/.config/nvim)
├── hyprland          # Hyprland window manager config (in ~/.config/hypr)
└── waybar            # Waybar config (in ~/.config/waybar)
```

---

## 🔸 Why NixOS?

I use **NixOS** 'cause I like things that don’t break randomly. It's fully declarative, super neat, and once you get it—kinda addictive. ( nah don't listen to ai, I just wanted that cool flake logo, and nixos was my first ever linux distro too idk man nix looks cool to me and it is cool )

> If you're curious why it's cool, watch [Vimjoyer’s NixOS video](https://www.youtube.com/@vimjoyer).

---

## 🔸 Home Manager (standalone style)

Standalone Home Manager lets me handle all my user stuff without touching the system layer. Super modular. Super clean.

> Wanna try it? Here's a [good video to start with](https://youtu.be/FcC2dzecovw?si=HUbmg8MK8kuPHIOi).

---

## 🔸 Neovim, Obviously

Yeah I use Neovim. This setup's fast, simple, and gets out of the way so I can actually write code.

Path: `~/.config/nvim`

---

## 🔸 Hyprland & Waybar

Using **Hyprland** as my window manager—it’s still a bit of a WIP (getting riced slowly lol), but usable and snappy. Also running **Waybar** for the status bar. Nothing crazy fancy yet, but it works.

> And yeah—**hyprpaper** is handling wallpapers

---

## 🔸 Dev Setup Highlights

- Built for **web devs**—JS, React, etc.
- **Android Studio** is prepped for React Native (low-res issue is there tho, still figuring that out 😅)
- **ADB** is ready to go—building and running mobile apps is smooth

---

## 🔸 That’s a Wrap

Anyway, that’s the setup. If you're into NixOS or just want a system that doesn’t fight you, feel free to steal whatever. Peace out and happy hacking ✌️
